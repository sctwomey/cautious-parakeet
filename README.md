## Description

This E-commerce application will allow a user to find vinyl records by various search parameters including by: artist, genre, and vinyl record title. The application will also allow a user to add an item(s) to a cart, remove item(s) from a cart, and purchase an item(s) using Stripe. So, this application will ultimately assist a user to search through a wide selection of vinyl records directly from a MongoDB database from anywhere the user has a computer available, select the vinyl record(s) the user wishes from the record store's database, and purchase the vinyl record(s) using Stripe.
